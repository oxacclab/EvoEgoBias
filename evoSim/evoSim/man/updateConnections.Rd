\title{Update the strength of connections between agents}
\usage{
updateConnections(modelParams, agents, world, ties)
}
\arguments{
\item{modelParams}{parameters for the model as a named list}

\item{agents}{data.frame of agents}

\item{world}{list of world properties (\code{state} obtained from
\code{\link{getWorldState}}, and \code{generation}, and \code{decision}
numbers.)}

\item{ties}{square matrix of connections between agents}
}
\value{
a square matrix similar to \code{ties} containing updated connection strengths
}
\description{
Agents' connection strengths can update dynamically. Customising
  this function will allow this to happen. This function is called as the
  last step in the decision process, after final decisions have been made and
  evaluated by \code{\link{getFitness}}.
